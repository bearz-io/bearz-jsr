/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * An assertion library that wraps the chai assertion library
 * and uses some of the Deno standard library's `@std/assert` module
 * to provide an opinionated set of assertions.
 *
 * It is primarily used for testing for various bearz.io modules to make it
 * easier to write tests and switch between testing frameworks (deno test and vitest).
 *
 * ## Documentation
 *
 * Documentation is available on [jsr.io](https://jsr.io/@bearz/assert/doc)
 *
 * ## Usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { equal, ok, nope } from "@bearz/assert";
 *
 * equal(1, 1);
 * ok(true);
 * nope(false);
 * ```
 *
 * ## License
 *
 * [MIT License](./LICENSE.md)
 *
 * is_error, unimplemented, rejects, and internal functions are from
 * the deno @std/assert module which is also MIT licensed.
